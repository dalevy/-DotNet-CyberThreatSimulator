# -DotNet-CyberThreatSimulator
The prototype for a C#/.NET Network Simulator. The goal was to allow simulation participants to connect and await instructions to start the cyber threat simulation. The project is incomplete as it was started during the last month of my summer internship period. Key features: Communications model with data serialized to custom XML network wrappers, Windows Management Instrumentation Query for host hardware profile, SQLite embedded database for configurations - All work was done by me; with minor snippets from the internet.
